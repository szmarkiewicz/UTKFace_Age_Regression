# Introudction to Machine Learning  
In the project UTKFace datesets is used. (https://susanqq.github.io/UTKFace/)  
The main goal of the project is to estimate age of a person based on image.  

Different approaches:
1. Convolutional Neural Networks
2. Transfer Learning with ResNet architecture
3. Transfer Learning with MobileNet architecture
